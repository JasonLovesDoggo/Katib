[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Jasonlovesdoggo/katib)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/katib)

A simple Go API for showcasing GitHub activity on your portfolio üìú

Need to show off your latest coding work? Katib grabs your most recent meaningful commits and your contribution streaks 
from GitHub, so you can display them anywhere you want.

## What it does 

- **Smart commit filtering:** Only shows commits with actual substance (5+ line changes), skipping the tiny fixes
- **Repository exclusions:** Skip specific repos you don't want to showcase 
- **Language breakdown:** Shows what languages you used in each commit
- **Contribution streaks:** Track your current streak and personal best
- **Fast API:** Uses GitHub's GraphQL API for quick responses
- **Built-in caching:** Responses are cached for 30 seconds to stay under rate limits

## Endpoints

### `GET /commits/latest`
Returns your most recent meaningful commit with details about changes and languages used.

### `GET /streak`
Returns your current GitHub contribution streak and your all-time best streak.

```json
{
  "currentStreak": 47,
  "highestStreak": 124,
  "active": true,
